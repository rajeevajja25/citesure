## Disclosure
This project used AI tools for specific tasks. Full transparency provided.

## What AI Assisted
- FastAPI structure suggestions
- Pydantic model syntax
- Regex pattern ideas
- Documentation templates
- Debugging help

## What Was Manual
- Verification scoring algorithm
- API integration code
- PDF/URL processing logic
- Frontend JavaScript
- All real API calls

## Split
