# Prompts for FastAPI + Render Deployment

## 1. Fix ModuleNotFoundError
I am getting this error on Render.com:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'

My requirements.txt exists in the project root.
My current Start Command is: uvicorn main:app --reload

Why is this happening and what is the exact fix?

## 2. Setup New Project
Create a FastAPI project for Render.com with:
- main.py with a simple endpoint
- requirements.txt (fastapi, uvicorn)
- The correct Start Command for Render dashboard
- Instructions on where to put the files

## 3. Run Locally
How to run this FastAPI app locally?
Give me the terminal commands and the test URL.
